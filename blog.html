             <div id="id9" class="cla1 cla4"><h3>Positive impacts:</h3></div>
             <div id="id10" class="cla1">As technology is a result of constant research for human needs it has been able to support us in many
            good ways especially in increasing the productivity with the help of automation. Many factories are
            using robots instead of human labor for dangerous and tedious work while increasing the efficiency.
            Telecommunication and internet is another good boon of technology which has decreased the distance
            of our global reach and really made our world a global village because we can connect to anyone
            anywhere in this earth within seconds and also helped in education as more educational materials are
            available in internet and online learning is being used recently. Entertainment is a need for human which
            can be available in all sorts of forms as a result of technology as well as business are using e-commerce
            to improve their facilities. Hospitals have better healthcare due to different high tech computers and
            advancements as well as telemedicine. Similarly, security devices, surveillance cameras and safety
            devices are making people safer in modern world and also due to smart devices like washing machines
            people's daily life has become comfortable.</div>

            <div id="id11" class="cla1 cla4"><h3>Negative impacts:</h3></div>
            <div id="id12" class="cla1">Although there are many pros about technology it also comes with cons generally
             like lack of employment as many human workers are being replaced by robots and automation. Moreover, such
            high end devices use more energy it also relates to impacts on climate and pollution. There is also a
            great risk of cyber-attacks and data breaches as important data are handled through computers.
            Similarly, due to easy access to different apps and information people are losing their composure and
            also effected with information overload as well as are mentally weak due to less social interaction and
            overuse of technology. In spite of technology helping humans in getting easy life it indirectly increases
            the dependency over it and people will lose to reach their potential. There is also a great concern of
            leaking of private information as there is lack of privacy and more surveillance which makes people fear
            and may lead to being isolated from outside world. Also, as the demand of technology rises many
            natural resources are being over consumed and the world is getting more polluted.</div>

        <div id="id14" class="cla1">Technology is playing a vital role in every business and it does same to bonsai plant business. Due to the
            rise of ecommerce the way bonsai plants are being sold has changed a lot from people coming to shops
            to plants being send off to customer's home. Internet and online marketplace like Amazon and even a
            
            personal business website are helping sellers to grow and reach more customers at different places.
            Putting up advertisement has never been easy as different social media platforms can be used to sell
            those products with minimal things like a photo and contacts. People who want a bonsai can just simply
            search in internet and find a variety of products and sellers and also get connected to them which has
            given a growth to small business with low funds for marketing. Even after the purchase sellers can help
            by keeping track of the bonsai plants through many apps and software and customers can also ask for
            videos for maintenance.</div>

        <div id="id15" class="cla1 cla4"><h3>Overall conclusion:</h3></div>
        <div id="id16" class="cla1">As technology advances in coming future we all should accept it as it has various pros but also keep in
            mind of its negative impacts and not let ourselves be too dependent on it. Humans made tools and
            technology for our own benefits so we cannot stop the development in that field rather should
            appreciate the advantages on our lives and also aware others of misuse of some cons.
            On the context of bonsai business and technology , we can clearly see the many small home business
            flourishing as they market their products through internet and customers also have easy access to the
            bonsai plants and maintain it easily watching many videos or contacting sellers but it is important for
            buyers as well as sellers to have consciousness about the shortcomings in that process as it may lead to
            many misunderstanding in near future because of many issues like shipments and even difference in
            quality.</div>
