                    Bonsai boy is a big bonsai plant seller which has network in different countries. The links for different pages are also at the bottom of the webpages with too many of links with similar context and might confuse customers while trying to buy a plant. It might have information on many things but people tend to ignore those paragraphs and that makes them useless words which makes their website look rough and messy for a new customer. While in comparison to us we provide a clean webpage with only necessary information for customers. We also have better interface with different links.

                Given above is the website of another bonsai shop which is also popular. It seems to have many plants on sell but they are very hard to find and also as they sell other things except bonsai plants it makes it less convenient for a customer. It also seems to have less effort in the interface and normal non-tech buyers will have hard time figuring out the proper way for purchasing a plant. Whereas our website has proper navigation for what the customer wants and very easy to proceed even for a non-tech users.

                    This website sells many types of good bonsai plants and is a very popular in searches. It has similar interface to ours with easy navigation and limited and nice use of links. But our website has cheaper prices for similar plants and also provide more discount then flower aura. While the interface might feel similar we have better quality of visuals to what our buyers may want and also have better quality of plants with free delivery services.

                    This is another big website which is marketing bonsai trees all over the world. This website has better information with every species and way of maintaining the plant that are bought. But it has a difficulty in choosing the proper link for what we want as it has too many website element and makes it little crowded. Customers might get distracted with its large content and lose interest in buying the product but our website has proper navigation and let’s the buyer reach to product page with just one click and give them enough products to choose from. We have delivery and discount which helps them buy their product cheaper with best quality.

                    Bonsai Haat is a growing site where people visits to buy preferred bonsai trees. It provides good interface for users and also shows some good recommendations for quick view of price which is similar to what we have done with our website. It seems to lack some in depth content about the general type of bonsai which we have included in our websites. Our site also provides better quality in affordable pricing which is a plus point for using our website.
